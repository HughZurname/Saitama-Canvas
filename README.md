## dataMap

**Parameters**

-   `data`  

## drawCell

**Parameters**

-   `x` **int** coordinate of cell
-   `y` **int** coordinate of cell
-   `width` **int** of cell
-   `height` **int** of cell
-   `c` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** string representation of a colour, such as rgb(0,0,0), of cell

## gridColour

**Parameters**

-   `index` **int** of colour from palette array

Returns **any** string representation of colour

## drawPart

Maps over a 2d array and plots each value in the canvas as a grid reference

**Parameters**

-   `context` **any** to execute against
-   `grid` **any** 2d array of pixels for canvas
-   `ox` **any** offset value for x coordinate
-   `oy` **any** offset value for y coordinate

## clearPart

Maps over a 2d array and clears any solid pixels to ensure clean rendering and animations

**Parameters**

-   `context` **any** to execute against
-   `grid` **any** 2d array of pixels for canvas
-   `ox` **any** offset value for x coordinate
-   `oy` **any** offset value for y coordinate

## drawBeard

Draw the beard part in a desired location on any face

**Parameters**

-   `cb` **[animation](#animation)** executes the defined animation function callback

## stopAnimation

Stops the currently running animation

## tearLoop

Loops the Y coordinate of the tear for 200 frames

## dropShades

Updates the Y coordinate for the shades and stops when the eyes are reached

## growBeard

Updates the y coordinate of the additional beard until it reaches max length

## tearAnimation

Renders the tear when a user clicks on the eye

## beardAnimation

Renders the beard growth when a user clicks an already bearded chin

## shadesAnimation

Renders the shades dropping down from off screen when a user clicks on the forehead

## mouse

This handles the logic for what happens when a user clicks on a particular part of the canvas

**Parameters**

-   `evt` **any** mouse event passed in to function

## addEventListener

Controls for the buttons on the page to change between expressions.
In most cases some variables are reinitialised or redrawn.
